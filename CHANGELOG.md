### [1.7.9]

- Bug fix "Is Pin transparent ?"

### [1.7.8]

- NEW Feature "Show only to GM ?" : Quite simply regardless of the associated permissions it shows the note only to the gm, it is very useful when used with this other module to prepare notes for the GM or random encounter with the Ironmonk modules https://foundryvtt.com/packages/journal-icon-numbers, personally it saves me a lot of time in not continuously setting the permissions on the associated journal.
- NEW Feature "Is Pin transparent ?" : Now with a simple checkbox on the note configuration it is possible to make the icon transparent without wasting time looking for the transparent image file. Very useful for people who use maps with icons printed on the map and just want to show the tooltip when the cursor is over that image and it saves me a lot of time. NOTE: This configuration is applied only to the icon image of the note , not the image tooltip.
- Some clean up in preparation for fvtt v10

### [1.6.6]

- Some little update

### [1.6.5]

- Bug fix: Add try-catch on BackgroundlessControlIcon for manage use case of not reachable texture on the server, but the journal still work
- Bug fix: For the 'Show image instead text feature', for when no image is found on the linked journal/note and set the enrich html function for interaction
- NEW REQUEST: Add feature for 'Show image instead text feature', with a new file picker field if you have file browser permissions, so you can now add a specific image for the note if you don't want to show the original image on the linked journal, can be useful in some case...
- NEW REQUEST: Add new module setting 'Use mouse position for show the tooltip'.
- Solved (at least for me) the "HEIGHT AND WIDTH BUG" started from 1.6.0 with the new management the tooltip offset position with respect to the note is not static as you would expect it is based on a combination of x, y coordinates which also depend on the zoom level on the canvas, ~~unfortunately it is something that I have not been able to solve, any help in such sense is welcome.~~ On the plus side, the tooltip tends to always show towards the center of the view, perhaps in the mobile environment it is preferable for it to behave this way, so perhaps it is a more benign than evil bug. Waited for some feedback before trying to fix this again.
- Module settings 'noteGM' default set to 'false'

### [1.5.0] - 2021-06-05
- Added compatibility for [Foundry VTT v0.8.6](https://foundryvtt.com/releases/0.8.6) -- thanks @ethaks once again! 🎉
> Due to the massive changes in Foundry v0.8.x the way that Pin Cushion creates Player (Scene) Notes has changed. You now need to set the core permission `Create Map Notes` and the permission `Create Journal Entries`. If the `Create Journal Entries` permission is not set to allow Players to create Journal Entries, then players will receive a message when they try to create a Map Note using double-click. If the `Create Map Notes` permission is not set to allow Players to create Map Notes then no warning will be raised.

### [1.4.0] - 2021-04-18
- You can now set the default permission and folder when creating a Journal Note using Pin Cushion (thanks @saif-ellafi!)

- Players can now create Notes on the scene/map! (🎉 thanks @ethaks for this awesome new feature! 🙌)
